   By  Dave McNary  Film Reporter Zeitgeist Films has formed a joint venture with Syncopy, Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas’ production company, to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist’s prestige titles.
Nolan and Thomas have been friends of Zeitgeist since the independent distributor handled Nolan’s first feature film, “Following,” in 1998.
The first title in the partnership is “Elena,” from “Leviathan” director Andrey Zvyagintsev.
“Elena,” which won the Cannes’ Un Certain Regard Special Jury Prize, is a modern noir thriller in which 60ish spouses uneasily share a palatial Moscow apartment.
“Elena” stars Nedezhda Markina in the title role and features Hitchcockian music by Philip Glass.
Zeitgeist has set an Aug. 4 release.
“We are excited to be able to release this beautiful film on Blu-ray for the first time,” said Zeitgeist co-presidents Nancy Gerstman and Emily Russo.
“This is a dream project for us and we’re grateful to Chris and Emma for their support in making it possible.” The next collaboration between Syncopy and Zeitgeist will be a compilation of the Quay Brothers’ animated short films to be released for the first time on Blu-ray in the fall.
“It’s very exciting to think that ‘Elena’ is receiving an American release in Blu-ray,” said Zvyagintsev.
“As a long-time admirer of Christopher Nolan, I am honored that he is initiating his partnership with Zeitgeist with my film.
I wish all the parties involved success.”    A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment
